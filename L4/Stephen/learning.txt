Typescript reduces the boiler plate code
Not that we cannot do without TS, but in Angular2 they are using it
Can use JS also
Overcome JS pitfalls and its the latest JS
Typeof to find the datatype

Var a;

Typeof a;

All datatypes in JS will be within these:-
Bool, undefined, NaN, number, string, object, null

Type	Result
Undefined	"undefined"
Null	"object" (see below)
Boolean	"boolean"
Number	"number"
String	"string"
Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015)	"symbol"
Host object (provided by the JS environment)	Implementation-dependent
Function object (implements [[Call]] in ECMA-262 terms)	"function"
Any other object	"object"

Let gives the scope within the block

Class will have separate boundary but new memory for it

Let and var -> always use let

Constant is a variable that has its reference fixed
Const is also block level

Observables is a new primitive type which acts as a blueprint for how we want to create streams, subscribe to them, react to new values, and combine streams together to build new ones.


[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Abc12

[(12,34), (56,78)]

Reactive Programming

Function add(b, c) {
	return b + c;
}

Var c = add(1,23); // 4
Var d = add(2,10); // 12

Real-time 
add([data])

Data = (1,24)

1) First check whether
Data changed.
(Change Detection)
2) Do the operation
On the changed data

Real-time Example
—————————
Input box -> 23
23.00
Input-> 45
45.00
Input-> 45.78
46.78
Input-> 45.44
45.44
Input-> 45.99
46.00

toFixed()

On Blur of the input
Box, do that change

Input-> 2 // 4
245 // 4810

onKeyDown -> Call
The function
222222222

RxJS - Different Framework

-> Observable

Observable

Observables is a new 
primitive type 
which acts as a 
blueprint for how we
 want to create streams,
 subscribe to them,
 react to new values,
 and combine streams 
together to build new ones.

HTTP -> Data will be sent back

Promise

AngularJS
————
Request-> GET
Immediately give response -> Promise Object 
Dummy Placeholder for future Value
Waiting on the Promise.

Once the GET completes, I will get back the actual
data.
Data will be populated on the Promise.

Listen object- > resolves succeeds, I have data
Promise will reject to an error.


Observables -> Similar to Promise
ANY STREAM of DATA

Observable

1) Methods that can be chained and called

Angular-> [‘valueChanges’] - form Observable
