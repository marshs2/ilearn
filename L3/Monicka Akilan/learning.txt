Basics of Angular2:
AngularJS - Angular 1
Angular - Angular 2


Angular 2 and upgrades can be written in Typescript
Typescript - ECMAScript 6 Javascript 0r 2015
All browsers will support until javascript 5, 
if you write in Ecmascript 6 transpiler will convert to javascript 5 

Typescript - Microsoft developed solution for ECS 6 full specification and extra features useful for .net like type checking and annotation

Angular 2 is maintained by Google, then why its using typescript which is developed by Microsoft?
First google developed alternate script for ECMA6 but it should support in all browser, its difficult
So they decided to move to typescript which is a super set of ECMAC6
Typescript is a free and opensource

HTML - W3C Standard
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular2 - Is mostly like a class 
Class - A template or Blueprint / Complex or userdefined data type
Object - Real time output based on template 
Javascript is a function oriented language, have pseudo class 
which is main drawback of javascript

Typescript - Javascipt superset but it has classes

Initial setup of an object  - Plnkr.co -> Lauch the editor
SPA(a feature of typescript) - index html and all others will load partially
All data get lladed in first time, in next slides only the required assets to get loaded
Ajax is a part of SPA, it cant use routing, its just an async call
Only angular achieved SPA

base href = redundancy decrease
if we call folder1/folder2/folder3/folder4
if we give
<base href="folder1/folder2/folder3/folder4" />
then it will call only the required folder straightly

No need to import all html in sctipt tag - like angular AngularJS
in angular 2 this is handle by system.js the route will be given in config.js

In Angular CLI it will be in angular.cli.json
platformBrowserDynamic() 
Angular basically developed for browsers - 
but angular 2 we can use in many platform like mobile apps

Angular2  - Tree structure module
App modules
    |
    inner modules

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule - Main/root module/starting 
point of the application); 
similiar like PSVM

Component in angular2  - We can use that component directly 
@Component - a feature to use this class as a component in HTML

ngFor for looping in Angular
No let or var needed to describe a variable insede a component, 
but its needed inside a method
In simple global scope no needed and local/function scope needed

let is the best practice for defining variable. 
outside scope the variable get deleted
