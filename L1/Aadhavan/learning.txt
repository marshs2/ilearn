Geolocation

* W3C recommends browsers manufactures to maintain some standards

* Geolocation -> Find User Location

* Geolocation have 3 methods
	getCurrentPosition
	watchPosition
	clearWatch

* Callback is a function when success or error it call the particular function

* Success have cords and timestamps

Geolocation
? -> optional

* Map display using latitude and longitude then use google geolocation api

* Need the private key

* Use the map id in div class to display map in html page
* Normally the zoom level 16 represents street view 

* Need to Check
	Browser support
	Geolocation depends upon browser compatability

* Geolocation is Asynchronous javascript

* By default all website fetch the geolocation function at first priority. So, this must be asynchronous

* Who needs the geolocation?
	Accepetance Future
	Alternative in web future

* Where to Use?
	1. Geolocation function must be in Global Script
	    Modules who need the geo function call the function
	2. Geolocation depends compatible in browsers. So, we have to check it is working or not
	    Ex: if(navigator.appName ==""){//Not working}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Mordenizer
	mordenizer.navigator -> To check whether the browser is supporting geo or not
	Better to use the mordenizer
	This is not work in unsecure site

2.Customization of user acceptance popup
