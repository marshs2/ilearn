Local and session storage

when does a project decide to use local/session storage
	1. non db applications that need to communicate with separte pages
	2. non PCI data
	3. non SPA application: in case of SPA factories, service take responsiblity

how to use?
	decide on the format
	separation of concerns
	no interdependency...its not db..u cant have foreign keys

Bottlenecks for storage
	non formats only string...so use JSON.parse and stringify..oruse thirdparty
	cookie/storage decision
	PCI compliance
	


Challenges
	1. Encryption of Data
	2. global storage for session
	3. format of session storage
	4. application driven entirely by storage
